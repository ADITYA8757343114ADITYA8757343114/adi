# This function calculates the area of a rectangle
def rectangle_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:
    # The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width
    area = length * width
    
    # The area is then returned as the output of the function
    return area

# Adding type hints for function parameters and return value makes it easier for other developers to understand the expected input and output types.
