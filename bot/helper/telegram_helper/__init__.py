# This function calculates the area of a rectangle
def rectangle_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:
    # The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width
    area = length * width
    
    # The area is printed to the console with a more informative message
    # This can be useful for debugging or getting a quick readout of the area
    print(f"The area of the rectangle with length {length:.2f} and width {width:.2f} is {area:.2f}.")
    
    # The area is returned as the output of the function
    # This allows the result to be used in further calculations if needed
    return area

# Example usage:
result = rectangle_area(4, 5)
# The calculated area (20.00) can be used for further calculations.
